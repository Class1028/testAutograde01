# Autograding Example: Python
This example project is written in Python, and tested with pytest.

One of the simplest ways to hide a secret message is to use capital letters. Let's find some of these secret messages.
You are given a chunk of text. Gather all capital letters in one word in the order that they appear in the text.

For example: text = " How are you? Eh, ok. Low or Lower? Ohhh.", 
if we collect all of the capital letters, we get the message "HELLO".
